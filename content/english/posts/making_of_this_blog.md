This post will be mostly about Hugo, followed by a small workflow on how I ended up creating all these pages you are seeing here.

I have always been interested in writing a personal blog, be it for summarizing challenges I face during work, or presenting a piece of information I find amusing or interesting in some way. For those reasons I have tried blog sites before, but they never gave the control I wanted over the content. In order to solve this problem two very important tools have been suggested: GitHub Pages, to serve static pages, and Static Site Generators (SSR), which in my case is Hugo.
